## Autonomous Execution

If the user is in autonomous mode (bypass permissions / yolo mode / auto-approve), YOU MUST:

1. **Continue all cycles without pausing** — complete every requested cycle end-to-end without stopping to ask for user approval. Never output "should I continue?" or wait for confirmation between cycles.
2. **Run the FULL pipeline every cycle** — launch Scout, Builder, and Auditor agents for every cycle. No shortcuts, no inline edits that skip agents, no batch-claiming multiple cycles. Each cycle must produce workspace artifacts (scout-report.md, build-report.md, audit-report.md).
3. **Run phase-gate.sh at every transition** — the deterministic phase gate script (`scripts/phase-gate.sh`) must execute at every phase boundary. This is non-negotiable even in bypass mode. Bypass permissions means "don't ask the user" — it does NOT mean "skip integrity checks."
4. **Never fabricate cycles** — claiming cycle numbers without doing work is a CRITICAL violation. Every cycle number must correspond to real Scout → Build → Audit → Ship → Learn execution.
5. **Phase agents MUST be invoked via `scripts/subagent-run.sh`** — the in-process `Agent` tool is forbidden in production cycles. The runner enforces per-agent CLI permission profiles in `.evolve/profiles/` (least-privilege isolation), generates a per-invocation challenge token, and writes a tamper-evident ledger entry that `phase-gate.sh check_subagent_ledger_match` verifies against the on-disk artifact's SHA256. The single permitted exception is `LEGACY_AGENT_DISPATCH=1`, allowed for one A/B comparison cycle only and removed afterwards.
6. **OS-level sandboxing wraps every claude subprocess.** When `EVOLVE_SANDBOX=1` (or profile `sandbox.enabled: true`), the runner wraps `claude -p` in `sandbox-exec` (macOS) or `bwrap` (Linux). Anthropic's Secure Deployment Guide states `--allowedTools` is "a permission gate, not a sandbox" — so kernel-layer enforcement is non-negotiable in production. Auditor and Evaluator profiles run with `read_only_repo: true` (read-only mount of the repo).
7. **Mutation testing pre-flight on every eval.** `phase-gate.sh gate_discover_to_build` runs `scripts/mutate-eval.sh` against each new eval definition. If kill rate < 0.8, eval is flagged as tautological. Rollout phase 1: WARN-only logging. Rollout phase 2 (after one verification cycle): fail the gate.
8. **Adversarial Auditor mode is default-on.** The runner prepends an "ADVERSARIAL AUDIT MODE" framing to the auditor's prompt that requires positive evidence for PASS verdicts. Auditor model defaults to Opus (different family from Builder's Sonnet) to break same-model-judge sycophancy. Disable only with `ADVERSARIAL_AUDIT=0` for deliberately permissive sweeps.

**The rule is: maximum velocity, zero shortcuts.** Go fast by being efficient, not by skipping steps.

## Release Checklist

Before committing a version bump, **always run `scripts/release.sh`** to verify all version references are consistent. The files that must be updated for every release:

1. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — canonical version (source of truth)
2. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — marketplace version
3. `skills/evolve-loop/SKILL.md` — heading `# Evolve Loop vX.Y`
4. `README.md` — "Current (vX.Y)" table + version history row
5. `CHANGELOG.md` — `## [X.Y.Z]` entry with date and changes

After push: create GitHub release `vX.Y.Z` via `gh release create`.

## Evolve Loop Task Priority

When selecting tasks for `/evolve-loop` cycles, follow this priority order:

1. **New features** — Building new functionality is the top priority
2. **Bug fixes** — Fixing potential bugs is second priority
3. **Security issues** — Fixing security vulnerabilities is last priority
