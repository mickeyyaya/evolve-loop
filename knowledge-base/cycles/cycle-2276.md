# Cycle 2276 Dossier

**Goal:** Wave 164.

Work the highest-weight lane-eligible inbox items from start to end: claim, tdd, build, audit and ship. Keep full phase integrity.

Every cycle must:
- commit to a claimed inbox item (an empty top_n must not run the spine);
- bind its audit to the changes tree that it ships;
- disposition its own defect ledger and the inherited ids;
- record a terminal outcome on every exit;
- never change a protected control-plane file with a tool;
- leave no stale worktree.

Routing:
- An item whose declared fix surface is a protected file is console work. A pipeline-integrity item that the operator did not route to the lanes is also console work.
- An item that has `route: lane` is lane work. ADR-0099 document deliverables are lane work.
- A card on a protected surface is a route, not a verdict. The cycle ends as planned no-work, and the item goes to the console.

Craft:
- New and changed code has no comments. Names, types and tests give the intent.
- Write each new document and each new log text in ASD-STE100.
- A git-backed test fixture uses internal/gittest. It never uses a raw `git init`.
- A lane never changes go/internal/sizeratchet/offenders.json or the deadline of a gate.

Evidence:
- To know what a cycle did, read the cycle state and the signals (`evolve wave status`). Do not read the text log.

The measure of this wave is the number of shipped cycles. Keep each cycle shipping.

Wave 163 facts (run 20261109T204337Z): 14 of 16 cycles shipped.
- Cycle 2252: final verdict FAIL. Termination: cycle aborted in phase retro (abnormal-exit epilogue) cause=…tomic-ship] ship: fleet ff-merge cycle-cd3ae73e-2252 into main diverged (a peer cycle moved main mid-pipeline); rebase + re-verify the merged tree, then re-ship.
