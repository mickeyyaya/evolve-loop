# Cycle 642 Dossier

**Goal:** Optimize per-agent token usage across all phase agents (Scout, Builder, Auditor, orchestrator, and supporting agents): trim verbose agent prompts, cut redundant context/artifact injection, and tighten report sizes so the pipeline is more stable (fewer context-limit and quota failures) and faster per cycle. Preserve every phase-integrity guarantee and gate behavior.
**Final verdict:** FAIL
**Run ID:** 01KX560N234FF30TSRSAFYZ1NV

## Phases

| Phase | Archetype | Verdict | Duration | Key Findings |
|-------|-----------|---------|----------|--------------|
| cycle-recorded |  | FAIL |  | cycle completed; ledger walk deferred to future slice |

## Defects

- **audit-fail** (HIGH): cycle did not pass audit; see audit-report.md + acs-verdict.json — fix: address the audit findings recorded for this cycle


## Carryover

- **address-audit-findings** (high): resolve the audit findings that failed cycle 642
