# Cycle 1569 Dossier

**Goal:** Work ordinary high-value bug fixes from the inbox. EXCLUDE one item reserved for console work: transient-artifact-timeout-shortcircuit-the-silence-budget — do not select it. Prefer defects where a produced signal has no consumer, and prove each fix fires on the real production path, not only in unit tests. A bug-reproduction deliverable must land WITH its passing fix or carry t.Skip until fixed — a red test on main blocks every lane.
**Final verdict:** FAIL
**Run ID:** 01M0YVYDAFAYC6XMPBA06CM8E7
