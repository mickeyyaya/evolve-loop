package flagregistry

// registry_table.go — the flag data. Seeded mechanically 2026-06-11 from the
// repo-wide inventory + control-flags.md tables; hand-maintained since.
// KEEP SORTED BY NAME (Lookup binary-searches; the test enforces order).

// All is the complete EVOLVE_* flag registry, sorted by Name. It is the SSOT
// projected into control-flags.md; Lookup binary-searches it, so it must stay
// sorted (TestAll_SortedByName enforces this).
